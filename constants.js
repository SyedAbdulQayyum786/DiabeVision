const about_text = "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a progressive eye condition that affects individuals with diabetes, resulting from prolonged high blood sugar levels that damage the small blood vessels in the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye responsible for vision. Diabetic Retinopathy can lead to visual impairment and blindness if left untreated. It typically develops over time and is one of the leading causes of vision loss worldwide. High blood glucose levels cause damage to the retinal capillaries, leading to leakage, blockage, or abnormal new blood vessel growth. This process can progressively impact vision and is categorized into two main stages: Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR) and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR). Diabetic Retinopathy can be classified into five key types based on its severity and progression. In the early stage, known as Mild Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (Mild NPDR), small balloon-like swelling (microaneurysms) form in the retinal blood vessels, which may leak fluid into the retina, though vision is usually unaffected. As the condition progresses to Moderate Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (Moderate NPDR), the retinal blood vessels begin to swell, and microaneurysms increase in number, causing leakage of blood or fluid, which can lead to slight blurring of vision. In Severe Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (Severe NPDR), many blood vessels become blocked, depriving large areas of the retina of blood supply (ischemia), and the retina signals for new blood vessels to grow, increasing the risk of progression to the proliferative stage. At the advanced stage, known as Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR), abnormal new blood vessels (neovascularization) form on the surface of the retina or optic disc. These fragile vessels can rupture, causing vitreous hemorrhage (bleeding into the eye) and scarring, which may result in complications like retinal detachment and blindness."
